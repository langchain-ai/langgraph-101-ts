      "LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications that use large language models (LLMs). It provides reusable building blocks to connect LLMs to data sources, tools, memory, and external services, so you can create chatbots, question-answering systems, automation agents, and other LLM-powered apps more easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key concepts it offers:\n",
      "- LLM: Wrappers around language models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, local models).\n",
      "- Prompts and Prompt templates: Structured ways to compose prompts.\n",
      "- Chains: Sequences of steps (prompt + model calls + post-processing) to transform inputs into outputs.\n",
      "- Tools: External APIs or functions that an app can call (search, compute, fetch data, etc.).\n",
      "- Agents: Decision-makers that choose which tools to use and when, based on the LLM’s output.\n",
      "- Memory: Keeps context across interactions (useful for chatbots and ongoing conversations).\n",
      "- Vector stores and document loaders: For retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and knowledge-grounded QA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common uses:\n",

      "- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over documents or knowledge bases\n",
      "- Automated workflows that call external tools or APIs\n",
      "- Data analysis and summarization pipelines\n",
      "\n",
      "Languages and setup:\n",
      "- Primary support is for Python (LangChain) and JavaScript/TypeScript (LangChain.js)\n",
      "- Installation example: pip install langchain (plus any provider packages like openai)\n",

      "- Acts: It uses actuators or some mechanism to affect the environment.\n",

      "- Autonomy: It operates on its own, making decisions based on what it senses and what it knows.\n",

      "Common types and examples:\n",
      "- Simple reflex agent: Responds to current inputs with fixed actions (e.g., a light switch that turns on when it’s dark).\n",
      "- Thermostat: Perceives temperature and turns the heater on/off to reach a target temperature.\n",
      "- Self-driving car: Senses road conditions, traffic, and pedestrians, and makes driving decisions.\n",
      "- Software agent (e.g., an email spam filter): Perceives incoming mail and decides whether to mark it as spam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Components you’ll hear about:\n",
      "- Sensors: How the agent perceives the world.\n",
      "- Decision maker: How it chooses actions (rules, models, learning).\n",
      "- Actuators: How it changes the world (robot wheels, software actions, etc.).\n",
      "- Knowledge/model: Information about the world it uses to decide.\n",
      "- Sometimes learning: It can improve its decisions over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important notes:\n",
      "- An agent is not necessarily human or intelligent; it can be a simple rule-based system.\n",
      "- In AI, “agent” often implies some level of autonomy and goal-directed behavior, possibly in a complex, changing environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Edges**\n",
