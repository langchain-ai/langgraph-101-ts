    "1. ✅ Installed Node.js (v20+) and pnpm\n",
    "2. ✅ Run `pnpm install` from `/Users/victormoreira/Desktop/demos/langgraph-101-ts`\n",
    "3. ✅ Created a `.env` file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n",

It provides higher-level building blocks to orchestrate LLM calls, manage prompts and memory, integrate data sources, and even act autonomously using tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core concepts you’ll often use in LangChain:\n",
      "- LLMs and Prompting: wrap LLM calls and define prompts (including templates and few-shot formats).\n",
      "- Chains: sequences of steps that combine prompts, LLMs, and other logic into a single workflow.\n",
      "- Memory: store and retrieve state across interactions (for more coherent chats or multi-turn tasks).\n",
      "- Agents and Tools: agents can decide which tools (APIs, databases, search, code execution, etc.) to use to accomplish a goal.\n",
      "- Tools: wrappers around external actions (e.g., web search, Python execution, database queries).\n",
      "- Vector stores: store and retrieve embeddings for retrieval-augmented generation (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).\n",
      "- Data & evaluation: document loaders, parsers, and debugging/tracing utilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical use cases:\n",
      "- Chatbots and virtual assistants with memory and tool use.\n",
      "- Question-answering with external data (retrieval-augmented generation).\n",
      "- Multi-step reasoning pipelines (summarization, analysis, and decision making).\n",
      "- Automating workflows that require LLM-generated results and actions via tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started (high level):\n",
      "- Install: pip install langchain (Python) or npm install langchain (TypeScript/JavaScript).\n",
      "- Create a simple prompt, wrap an LLM, and run a chain or a basic QA setup.\n",
