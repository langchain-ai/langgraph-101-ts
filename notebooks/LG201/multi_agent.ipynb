    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've built a complete multi-agent customer support system using TypeScript and LangChain v1, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReAct Agents**: Built both from scratch and using `createAgent` (the v1 replacement for `createReactAgent`)\n",
    "2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Created a supervisor that delegates to specialized subagents\n",
    "3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Implemented customer verification using the `interrupt` function\n",
    "4. **Long-Term Memory**: Added memory storage and retrieval for personalized interactions\n",
    "5. **Tool Injection**: Used `InjectedState` to pass state data to tools seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key LangChain v1 Migration Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Used `createAgent` from `langchain` instead of deprecated `createReactAgent`\n",
    "- ✅ Used `interrupt()` for human-in-the-loop interrupts\n",
    "- ✅ Used `Command.resume()` to resume from interrupts\n",
    "- ✅ Properly configured state with `Annotation` and reducers\n",
    "- ✅ Used `InjectedState` for passing state to tools\n",
    "\n",
    "For production deployments, consider:\n",
    "- Adding comprehensive error handling\n",
    "- Implementing proper logging and monitoring\n",
    "- Setting up LangSmith for evaluation and tracing\n",
    "- Adding rate limiting and authentication\n",
    "- Testing edge cases and error scenarios\n"
